# Requirements
* Capture High level requirements and Low level requirements fro each high level requirements
* Requirements must clearly call out all the feature of the system
* Components in the Circuit
Solar panel

10KÎ© x 3
Servo Motor
16MHz Crystal
22pF Ceramic Capacitors x 2
Push Button
Breadboard
Cardboard
Connecting Wires

## High level Requirements 
* Each use case is a high level requirement

## Low level Requirements
* Each use case has multiple steps and is a low level requirement
* All corner cases also can become part of low level requirements

## SWOT Analysis

## 4W's and 1'H
